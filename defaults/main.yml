# The Active Directory / DNS domain and Kerberos Realm.
#
# You should always use a subdomain of your domain name (e.g. ad.example.org).
# Never use your domain name (example.org) for your AD DNS domain. Read
# https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Active_Directory_Naming_FAQ for more
# information.
#
# IMPORTANT: Changing the AD domain later is a non-trivial task, so it is
# important to get it right the first time!
